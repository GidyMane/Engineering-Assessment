## 1 Longest Consecutive Sequence

### Problem Description:
Given an array of integers, return the longest sequence of consecutive numbers.

### Example:
**Input:**
```python
[100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]




# Book Library API (FastAPI + SQLite)

This is a simple **Book Library API** built using **FastAPI** and **SQLite**.

##  Features
Add books (title, author, year)  
List all books  
Update book details  
Delete books by ID  
Search books by title or author  
Sort books by year (asc/desc)  

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/book_library_api.git
cd book_library_api



#  Fibonacci Debugging & Fixes

## Problem Statement
The original Fibonacci function was inefficient due to excessive recursive calls, leading to **O(2‚Åø) exponential complexity**.

## Fixed Implementations
1. **Recursive with Memoization (`lru_cache`)** - Optimized recursion with **O(n) time**.
2. **Iterative Approach** - Best for large `n` with **O(n) time and O(1) space**.

##  How to Run
Clone the repository and run:
```sh
python fibonacci.py
